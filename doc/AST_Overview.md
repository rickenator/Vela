# Vyn AST Design Document - Overview

*(Note: This document provides an overview and table of contents for the Vyn Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) documentation. The detailed descriptions of AST nodes and design considerations are split into separate, focused documents.)*

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for the Vyn programming language. The AST is a crucial intermediate representation of the source code, generated by the parser. It serves as the primary data structure for subsequent compilation phases, including semantic analysis, type checking, optimization, and code generation.

The AST aims to faithfully represent the syntactic structure of the Vyn code, encompassing both current capabilities and future language extensions.

## 2. Table of Contents

This documentation is split into several parts:

*   **[Core AST Design](./AST_Core.md)**: Describes the base `Node` class, fundamental AST structures, the `NodeType` enum, and the Visitor pattern.
*   **[Literals](./AST_Literals.md)**: Details AST nodes representing various literal values (integers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, etc.).
*   **[Expressions](./AST_Expressions.md)**: Covers AST nodes for different kinds of expressions (unary, binary, calls, member access, etc.).
*   **[Statements](./AST_Statements.md)**: Explains AST nodes for statements (blocks, if, for, while, return, etc.).
*   **[Declarations](./AST_Declarations.md)**: Details AST nodes for declarations (variables, functions, structs, enums, etc.).
*   **[Types](./AST_Types.md)**: Focuses on AST nodes related to type representations (`TypeNode`).
*   **[Patterns](./AST_Patterns.md)**: *(Planned)* Describes AST nodes for pattern matching constructs.
*   **[Design Considerations](./AST_Design_Considerations.md)**: Discusses various design choices, alternatives, and rationale behind the AST structure. This includes topics like memory management, error handling, and potential future enhancements.
*   **[Roadmap](./AST_Roadmap.md)**: Outlines planned AST nodes and future development directions for the AST.

*(The original `AST.md` served as the basis for these documents and will be phased out.)*
